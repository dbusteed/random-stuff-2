very simple zoo tycoon!
- manage a zoo, get visitors, make attractions
- build enclosures
    - different types of fences / gates, 4-bit maps for theses (LATER)
        - brick
        - wood
        - wire
    - for now just stick with the kenny assets
    - but will need bitmask for the sidewalks cause that's important
    - different durability sprites
- more traditional mouse-based tycoon
- mvp no scrolling map, but maybe later
- still need build menus, etc
- but NO "PLAYER" (ie controllable move around guy)
- so hud with key metrics, and even clickable menus (shortcuts too)
    - front office
    - staff
    - animals
    - build

still could have some level of "skill progression" in the form
of hiring employees or market research, or like you pay to 
run a survey, and then you get to analyze the results

but we don't want to get too in the weeds like this guy handles the tickets, this guy changes the toilet paper, if it's abstract it's
okay but if i have to simulate that it's too much. so ya scale that back a bit. maybe just hire staff, and there can be different levels of staff, i.e. a 5-star zookeeper will be better for the animals but has a higher salary, same with maintainence / cleaners.



happy animals
- food, enclosure, friends, visitors

money
- payoff loan
- adjust ticket prices
- advertising
- visitors vary by zoo score
- maybe animals have varying populatarity
