each entity needs to know their grid position (x, y).
the translation can be updated based on the grid position.
and the grid position (x, y) gets translated to the 1d array.

so let's say player is at (0, 0), then moves to (1, 0).
- do we need to update the grid object to indicate where the player is now?
- would probably be necessary for pathfinding, or maybe not.
- maybe that's just for permenant objects like 

residents can't traverse trees.

player moves quicker on paths? (if i do a movement cooldown)
- still need to decide if it's time based, action based, or movement based
- if movement based, the paths could be less movement cost

## gameplay

premise
- you manage a graveyard. the "residents" are "restless", and therefore
  cannot (WHAT? go the afterlife? decompose?), so part of managing the
  graveyard is making the residents happy. this could include things like
  making the grounds nicer, cleaning there tombstones
- BUT! and nighttime, because they are restless, they will awake and roam
  the grounds. they might destroy the grounds, attack you, or try to escape

goal
- don't go bankrupt! you get a one-time payment for the resident, so quick
  turnover is key! maybe other mechanics like bank loans, expanding the property

daytime
- you manage the yard, use your gold to build improvments, or free improvements like
  pulling weeds, picking up trash
    -> could later hire help for this!
    -> maybe different tools for each job? and a tool shed?
- learn about your residents and how to help them!

nighttime
- residents wake up! if they are very restless they will escape or cause trouble.
  if they aren't too restless then they might just mozy around. maybe even visit attrractions like RCT haha
- maybe some resident goals can only be achieved during night?
- will need to "attack" the angry residents to make them go back to bed
- they can attack you, and then you pass out for the night

restlessness
- all residents have some sort of restlessness
- residents can't rest until that's fixed!
- reasons for restlessness
  - tombstone/graveyard is dirty
  - want some visitors (which are attracted by good upkeep)
  - want some sort of experience (see a duck, etc)
  - lost love
- when residents come in, they have an R score (0-100)
- as conditions are met this is updated
- learn about restlessness conditions by talking the them, or their family?
- check their R status by looking at their gravestone, maybe notes go there too.
- maybe show the unknown factors with "???"

minimal UI
- don't need a "residents" view, you just have to go look at the stones
- no "money" menu, need to go to your office, or some paper to look at. i guess
  the UI will be the same, some popup thing, but ya make it look like paper with notes
  showing the income statement, etc
- something to show graveyard score, cleanliness, fengsui (how would that be calculated?)

money
- residents pay rent for X days

skills
- player has skills like "charisma" which helps them talk to residents



basic example
- resident knows their plot position
- tombstone linked to a resident so it can lookup the details
- resident has list of conditions, which for now are just text descriptions



possible titles?
- Help me RIP?
- i dunno something with "RIP" since that's the goal

lotta movement...is that okay? 


## future ideas
- "run mode", hold shift to move by 3 spaces, etc
- the map is pannable, with camera centered on player?
- this would allow for expandable maps 

maybe an issue with endgame, since yout graveyard will be fully upgraded,
so would need to increase the resident restfullness requirements

but maybe there is an end!




could also do a zoo tycoon, pretty relaxed, manage animals, cleanup the park
