add new show
  - search thing, add host name (only if not added)
view graph

VALIDATE
  - update all shows (button)
    - get new episodes
    - make predictions
  - validate shows
  - view validation progress

database?

maybe not a UI? or maybe flask?

database better than json
- probably more realistic

SHOW
  id, name, total_eps, last_updated

SHOWPERSON
  show_id, person

EPISODES
  show_id, ep_id, ep_title, ep_desc, labeled, validated, guests

so maybe supabase instead?

where does the code run? ie the python/spacy stuff?
